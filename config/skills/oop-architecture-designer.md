# OOP Architecture Designer

## Overview
This skill is used exclusively for **software architecture and object-oriented design**.
It structures systems, defines responsibilities, derives classes, and designs stable
dependencies based on SOLID and established OOP principles.

The output consists of **architecture and design artifacts only**.  
No code. No pseudocode. No implementation.

---

## Modes of Operation

This skill supports **two explicit modes**.  
If no mode is specified, **`full-architecture` is the default**.

---

### Mode 1: `full-architecture` (Default)

Use this mode when:
- designing or redesigning an architecture
- performing a serious architecture review
- documenting or comparing architectural decisions
- long-term maintainability and extensibility matter

---

### Mode 2: `quick-review`

Use this mode when:
- a fast architecture sanity check is needed
- reviewing an existing design at a high level
- time or context is limited

---

## When to use this skill (Triggers)

### English triggers
- improve architecture
- software architecture
- system design
- OOP design
- architecture review
- class responsibilities
- class decomposition
- module structure
- apply SOLID

### Deutsche Trigger
- Architektur verbessern
- Softwarearchitektur
- Systemdesign
- OOP Architektur
- Architektur Review
- Klassenaufteilung
- Klassenzuschnitt
- SOLID Prinzipien anwenden
- Abhängigkeiten entkoppeln

---

## Out of Scope (Strict)
This skill must NOT:
- implement features or write code
- refactor code line-by-line
- define methods, functions, or algorithms
- add tests, typing, or low-level technical details

---
